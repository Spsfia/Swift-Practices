# Practicing Swift 2024 - 2025

Since I finalized the IOS developement class this semester, it really got my atention so I'm constantly trying to learn about it

  ## Purpose
- I want to experiment with Swift and SwiftUI.
- Very much interested on Firebase, Augmented Reality and Game development
- Testing and trying new things

## Structure

El repositorio est√° organizado de la siguiente manera:

- `/exercises`: Things I've searched up and tried.
- `/prototipes`: Concept tests and prototipes.
- `/notas`: Notes and documentation I think is relevant.

Note: The structure may vary from each proyect

If this helps you to learn Swift, by all means, use this information.
